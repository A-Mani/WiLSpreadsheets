## Instructions

To add yourself to the list, copy the text below and paste it on a new line at the end of the relevant `.md` file, and then replace the filler text with your relevant information (i.e. replace `Surname` with your surname, `Given name` with your given name, and so on).

```
Surname | Given name | Institution (country) | Position | Website | Email | Areas (separate by commas)
```

If you wish to omit certain information then simply replace the corresponding word with a space, e.g. to leave the `Website` and `Email` fields blank, you would do as follows:

```
Surname | Given name | Institution (country) | Position | | | Areas (separate by commas)
```
